Hello, I am Gabriel from the tarjan cohort 

One of the hobbies i picked up during quarantine was cooking. 
I decided I wanted to be healthier and know what was in the food I was eating. 
I found it therapeutic and a good form of self care.  
However, I quickly learned that knowing what to make is almost always an issue for me. 
There are few experiences more frustrating than staring at the contents of my fridge for ten minutes, 
saying forget it, and before I know it I’m eating chipotle for the third time this week. 
Which isn't ideal.
So when it came time to do my solo project, 
I figured, why not build an app that does all of that thinking for me? 
And that’s exactly what I did. 
I created a mobile app, that I named nibbl, which I will go ahead and log into now.

So this is nibbl 

 to create it, i used  javascript, react, redux, node, postrgreSQL and css.

 one challenge I faced was my fear of regular CSS, but in the 
end it was nice not to rely on a CSS library. 


A few things I'd like to incorporate in the future is to use an api for the meals, 
have an image upload feature for the user profiles,  and add 
a feature where you get meal suggestions based on what you have in your fridge.

I'd like to thank my instructor Edan, prime academy, and my tarjan cohortmates for all of their
support
